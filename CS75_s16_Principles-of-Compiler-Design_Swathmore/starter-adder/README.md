#Adder

![An adder](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Loch_Shin_adder.JPG)

In this assignment you'll implement a compiler for a small language called
Adder (because it primarily adds things).

## Errata

- Test names cannot have spaces; this is due to the way the `Makefile` relies
  on test names being used for filenames.
- Note that in lecture, we used a `(string, int) avlnode` as the environment
  type, here we use a `(string * int) list`.  This is a simpler data structure
  that's often called an association list.  There is a provided `find`
  function that looks up a value (an `int`) by key (a `string`).  Adding to an
  association list is trivial – simply add onto the front with `::`.  You are
  responsible for understanding how ordering in the case of duplicate keys may
  interact with scope.
- The starter code had some annoying tab/space discrepancies.  Feel free to
  change to tabs or spaces consistently; neither the generated assembly nor
  the OCaml compiler relies on tab characters to work correctly.
- We used parentheses in some examples, like in `let x = (let y = 10 in y) in
  x`.  Parentheses are not part of the concrete syntax of Adder, so if you
  want to use this in a test, you must drop the parentheses.

## The Adder Language

In each of the next several assignments, we'll introduce a language that we'll
implement.  We'll start small, and build up features incrementally.  We're
starting with Adder, which has just a few features – defining variables, and
primitive operations on numbers.

There are a few pieces that go into defining a language for us to compile.

- A description of the concrete syntax – the text the programmer writes

- A description of the abstract syntax – how to express what the
  programmer wrote in a data structure our compiler uses.

- The _semantics_—or description of the behavior—of the abstrac
  syntax, so our compiler knows what the code it generates should do.


### Concrete Syntax

The concrete syntax of Adder is:

```
<expr> :=
  | <number>
  | <identifier>
  | let <bindings> in <expr>
  | add1(<expr>)
  | sub1(<expr>)

<bindings> :=
  | <identifier> = <expr>
  | <identifier> = <expr>, <bindings>
}
```

Here, a `let` expression can have one _or more_ bindings.


### Abstract Syntax


The abstract syntax of Adder is an OCaml datatype, and corresponds nearly
one-to-one with the concrete syntax.

```
type prim1 =
  | Add1
  | Sub1

type expr =
  | Number of int
  | Prim1 of prim1 * expr
  | Let of (string * expr) list * expr
  | Id of string
```


### Semantics

An Adder program always evaluates to a single integer.  `Number`s evaluate to
themselves (so a program just consisting of `Number(5)` should evaluate to the
integer `5`).  Primitive expressions perform addition or subtraction by one on
their argument.  Let bindings should evaluate all the binding expressions to
values one by one, and after each, store a mapping from the given name to the
corresponding value in both (a) the rest of the bindings, and (b) the body of
the let expression.  Identifiers evaluate to whatever their current stored
value is.  There are several examples further down to make this concrete.

The compiler should signal an error if:


- There is a binding list containing two or more bindings with the same name
- An identifier is unbound (there is no surrounding let binding for it)


Here are some examples of Adder programs:

| Concrete Syntax | Abstract Syntax | Answer |
------------------|-----------------|---------
| 5               | `Number(5)`     | 5      |
| sub1(add1(sub1(5))) | `Prim1(Sub1, Prim1(Add1, Prim1(Sub1, Number(5))))` | 4 |
| let x = 5 in add1(x) | `Let([("x", Number(5))], Prim1(Add1, Id("x")))` | 6 |
| let x = 5, y = sub1(x) in sub1(y) | `Let([("x", Number(5)), ("y", Prim1(Sub1(Id("x"))))], Prim1(Sub1("y")))` | 3 |

## Implementing a Compiler for Adder

You've been given a starter codebase that has several pieces of
infrastructure:

- A parser for Adder (`parser.mly` and `lexer.mll`), which takes concrete
  syntax (text files) and turns it into instances of the `expr` datatype.  You
  don't need to edit this.

- A main program (`main.ml`) that uses the parser and compiler to produce
  assembly code from an input Adder text file.  You don't need to edit this.

- A `Makefile` that builds `main.ml`, builds a tester for Adder that you will
  modify (`test.ml`), and manipulates assembly programs created by the Adder
  compiler.  You don't need to edit the `Makefile`, but you will edit
  `test.ml`.

- An OCaml program (`runner.ml`) that works in concert with the `Makefile` to
  allow you to compile and run an Adder program from within OCaml, which is
  quite useful for testing.  You don't need to edit `runner.ml`.

All of your edits—which will be to write the compiler for Adder, and test
it—will happen in `test.ml` and `compile.ml`.

### Writing the Compiler

The primary task of writing the Adder compiler is simple to state: take an
instance of the `expr` datatype and turn it into a list of assembly
instructions.  The provided compiler skeleton is set up to do just this,
broken up over a few functions.

The first is

```
compile : expr -> instruction list
```

which takes a `expr` value (abstract syntax) and turns it into a list of
assembly instructions, represented by the `instruction` type.  Use only the
provided instruction types for this assignment; we will be gradually expanding
this as the semester progresses.  This function has an associated helper that
takes some extra arguments to track the variable environment and stack
offset.  These will be discussed in more detail in lecture.

The other component you need to implement is:

```
to_asm_string : instruction list -> string
```

which renders individual instances of the instruction datatype into a string
representation of the instruction (this is done for you for `mov` and `ret`).
This second step is straightforward, but forces you to understand the syntax
of the assembly code you are generating.  Most of the compiler concepts happen
in the first step, that of generating assembly instructions from abstract
syntax.  Do use [this assembly
guide](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html) if you have
questions about the concrete syntax (or ask) of an instruction.

### Testing the Compiler

The test file has two helper functions that will be useful to you:

```
t : string -> string -> string -> OUnit.test
```

The first string given to `t` (test) is a test name, followed by an adder
program (in concrete syntax) to compile and evaluate, followed by a string for
the expected output of the program (this will just be an integer in quotes).
This helper compiles, links, and runs the given program, and if the compiler
ends in error, it will report the error message as a string.  This includes
problems building at the assembler/linker level, as well as any explicit
`failwith` statements in the compiler itself.


```
te : string -> string -> string -> OUnit.test
```

The first string given to `te` (test-error) is a test name, followed by a
program in concrete syntax to compile and evaluate, followed by a string that
is a _substring of the expected error message_.  For example, in the starter
code there is a test that fails with the substring `"not yet"`, because the
`Let` case fails with an exception that mentions it is `"not yet
implemented"`.  You _should_ use this helper to explicitly test for the two
error cases mentioned above, by raising a distinct string with `failwith` in
the compiler.

Both of these functions store the assembly file your compiler generated in the
`output/` directory, with the name of the test suffixed by `.s`, if it was
possible to generate.  So, for example, the starter tests generate a file
called `forty_one.s` in the `output/` directory, containing the compiled code
for that case.  This can be useful for debugging.  If you hand-edit a
generated assembly file (to tweak it for an attempted fix), you can then run:

```
make output/forty_one.run
```

to trigger the build from that assembly file.  This can be helpful if you
think you're generating mostly-correct code, but just want to try a small edit
to fix something up.  It's also helpful if you want to hand-write a small
assembly example: you can create `.s` files from scratch in the `output`
directory to experiment with, if you want to practice with assembly
instructions without the compiler in the way.

For files that built completely, the generated `*.run` executable is also
stored in `output/`.

### Running main

The `main` program built with `make main` takes a single file as its
command-line argument, and outputs the compiled assembly string on standard
out.  If you want to write files containing Adder code, you can write files in
the `input/` directory with the suffix `.adder`, and then run `make
output/yourfile.run`, which will trigger the same process that happens in
`test.ml` – the compiler will run on your adder file, and it will attempt to
link it with `main.c` to create an executable.  The intermediate files will be
stored in `output/yourfile.s`, `output/yourfile.o`, and `output/yourfile.run`.

You can run the file by executing:

```
$ ./output/yourfile.run
```
